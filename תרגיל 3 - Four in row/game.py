The heuristic function:
    For each cell in the board, the function checks
    the score of this cell by checking sequences.
    If its a victory, loss or tie, then the returned result
    is VICTORY, LOSS, TIE.
    Else, the returned result is addition of all the sequences' scores.

    Calculation of the sequence's score:
        If it's possible to win with a given sequence,
        then the sequence's score is calculated by the
        equation (num of pieces in place) / (num of moves to fill the sequence).
        If it's not possible to win with a given sequence,
        then the score is epsilon.
